# Financial Contributions Made to Presidential Candidates by Aaron Gruberg

I downloaded a csv file of contributions made to presidential candidates from 
Californians for the 2016 election.  I chose the 'CA.zip' file from http://classic.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do.  

I looked at how the money was distributed among candidates and which occupations and cities made the largest 
contributions.  Because most of the variables are categorical, I had to create
new variables from existing ones.  This dataset consists of 18 variables with 
1304346 observations. 

The file 'CA.Rmd' contains the R code that produces all plots and analysis for this report.  To view all visualizations and analysis, please download this repo and open 'CA.html'.
